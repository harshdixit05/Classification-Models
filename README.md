# Air Quality Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project builds a classification model to predict whether a site is **"Dangerous" or "Not Dangerous"** based on air pollution data. The model is trained using **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Trees**.

## Dataset
- **Features:**
  - **PM10 Concentration (µg/m³):** Level of coarse particulate matter.
  - **Proximity to Industrial Areas (km):** Distance to the nearest industrial zone.
- **Size:** 200 data points

## Approach
1. **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning and feature scaling.
2. **Model Training:** Implemented Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
3. **Evaluation:** Assessed accuracy using Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Results
- Model performance evaluated with classification metrics.
- Decision boundaries visualized for both models.
